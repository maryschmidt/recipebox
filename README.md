What is this?
---------------

This is me learning [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)!

I threw together this little recipe book app to see how Angular and Rails play together.  I like it!


Running locally
---------------

To setup the app:

    % ./bin/setup

After setting up, you can run the application using [foreman]:

    % foreman start

[foreman]: http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/
